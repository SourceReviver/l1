# l1

![build](https://github.com/eigenhombre/l1/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg)

`l1` is a small interpreted [Lisp
1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Lisp#The_function_namespace)
written in Go.  Emphasizing simplicity of data types (atoms,
arbitrarily large integers, and lists) and start-up speed, it aims to
be a playground for future language experiments.

`l1` eschews strings in favor of using atoms and lists in the style of
[some classic AI programs](https://github.com/norvig/paip-lisp).  It
features macros, tail-call optimization and a few unique functions for
converting atoms and numbers to lists, and vice-versa.

# Objectives

1. Provide a Lisp one can build roguelikes and other text games with.
1. Provide a Lisp for studying "[Good Old Fashioned
   AI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symbolic_artificial_intelligence)"
   programs such as those described in [Paradigms of Artificial
   Intelligence Programming](https://github.com/norvig/paip-lisp)
   (PAIP).
1. Answer the question, How far can we get without a 'string' data
   type?  (Much older Lisp pedagogy, including PAIP and
   [SICP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structure_and_Interpretation_of_Computer_Programs),
   does not refer to strings much or at all.)
1. Build a minimal language core and implement much of the language in
   the language itself (as is done in Clojure and many Common Lisp
   implementations).

# Status

The language core is largely complete.  However, I consider it a work
in progress still.  Issues and remaining work are [tracked on
GitHub](https://github.com/eigenhombre/l1/issues).

Although there are many tests, I expect plenty of bugs and
robustness issues remain.  The interpreter starts fast but, like most
tree-walking interpreters, is slow for longer calculations.

# Setup

You should have Go installed and configured (including [setting GOPATH](https://medium.com/@devesu/golang-quickstart-with-homebrew-macos-f3b3dacbc5dc)).  At some later point, pre-built
artifacts for various architectures may be available here.

To install `l1`,

    go install github.com/eigenhombre/l1@latest

Specific versions are tagged and available as well.  See [the tags
page](https://github.com/eigenhombre/l1/tags) for available versions
and then, for example,

    go install github.com/eigenhombre/l1@v0.0.15

At this point you should be able to run `l1`:

    $ l1 -h

to print a help message, or, to start a REPL:

    $ l1

# Usage

To execute a file:

    $ l1 <file.l1>

Example (using a file in this project):

    $ cat examples/fact.l1
    ;; Return the factorial of `n`:
    (defn fact (n)
      (if (zero? n)
        1
        (* n (fact (- n 1)))))))

    (print (fact 100))
    $ time l1 examples/fact.l1

# Example Programs

Several example programs are available in the
[`examples/`](https://github.com/eigenhombre/l1/tree/master/examples)
directory.  Most of these are run automatically as tests in the build.
These can be obtained either by cloning this repository, or after
installing `l1` by looking under `$GOPATH`. For example, if the
`latest` release is `v0.0.15`,

    $ ls $GOPATH/pkg/mod/github.com/eigenhombre/l1\@v0.0.15/examples/

Many of the [unit tests](https://github.com/eigenhombre/l1/blob/master/tests.l1) are written in `l1` itself.  Here are a few examples:

```
(test '(split and fuse)
  (is (= '(1) (split 1)))
  (is (= '(-1) (split -1)))
  (is (= '(-3 2 1) (split -321)))
  (is (= '(a) (split (quote a))))
  (is (= '(g r e e n s p u n) (split 'greenspun)))
  (is (= '(8 3 8 1 0 2 0 5 0) (split (* 12345 67890))))
  (is (= 15 (len (split (* 99999 99999 99999)))))
  (errors '(expects a single argument)
    (split))
  (errors '(expects a single argument)
    (split 1 1))
  (errors '(expects an atom or a number)
    (split '(a b c)))

  (is (= '() (fuse ())))
  (is (= 'a (fuse (quote (a)))))
  (is (= 'aa (fuse (quote (aa)))))
  (is (= 'ab (fuse (quote (a b)))))
  (is (= 1 (fuse (quote (1)))))
  (is (= 12 (fuse (quote (1 2)))))
  (is (= 125 (+ 2 (fuse (quote (1 2 3))))))
  (is (= 1295807125987 (fuse (split 1295807125987))))
  (errors '(expects a single argument)
    (fuse)))

(test '(factorial)
  (defn fact (n)
    (if (zero? n)
      1
      (* n (fact (- n 1))))))
  (is (= 30414093201713378043612608166064768844377641568960512000000000000
         (fact 50)))
  (is (= 2568 (len (split (fact 1000))))))
```

Several core library functions are also implemented in `l1`.  The file
[`l1.l1`](https://github.com/eigenhombre/l1/blob/master/l1.l1) contains these, and is evaluated when the interpreter starts.
This currently runs quite quickly (8-10 milliseconds on my Mac M1 Air).

# Local Development

Check out this repo and `cd` to it. Then,

    go test
    go build
    go install

Or, for a complete build with all tests, etc.,

    make

Testing and builds rely on GitHub Actions, Docker, and Make.  Please
look at the `Dockerfile` and `Makefile` for more information.

New releases are made using `make release`.  You must commit all
outstanding changes first.

# Emacs Integration

If you are using Emacs, you can set it up to work with `l1` as an "inferior
lisp" process as described in [the Emacs manual](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/External-Lisp.html).
I currently derive a new major mode from the base `lisp-mode` and bind a few
keys for convenience as follows:

    (define-derived-mode l1-mode
      lisp-mode "L1 Mode"
      "Major mode for L1 Lisp code"
      (setq inferior-lisp-program (executable-find "l1")
      (paredit-mode 1)
      (put 'test 'lisp-indent-function 1)
      (put 'testing 'lisp-indent-function 1)
      (put 'errors 'lisp-indent-function 1)
      (put 'if 'lisp-indent-function 1)
      (put 'if-not 'lisp-indent-function 1)
      (put 'foreach 'lisp-indent-function 2)
      (put 'when-not 'lisp-indent-function 1)
      (define-key l1-mode-map (kbd "s-i") 'lisp-eval-last-sexp)
      (define-key l1-mode-map (kbd "s-I") 'lisp-eval-form-and-next)
      (define-key l1-mode-map (kbd "C-o j") 'run-lisp))

    (add-to-list 'auto-mode-alist '("\\.l1" . l1-mode))

If `l1` has been installed on your path, `M-x run-lisp` or using the appropriate
keybinding should be enough to start a REPL within Emacs and start sending
expressions to it.
